# Professional Practice Assignment #1
Intro to Unit Testing &amp; T/BDD

## Functions
Functions implemented in this PPA were:
 - **Body Mass Index**
    - Input height in feet and inches. Input weight in pounds.
    - Returns BMI value and category: 
        - Underweight = <18.5
        - Normal weight ! = 18.5–24.9
        - Overweight = 25–29.9
        - Obese = BMI of 30 or greater 
    - Converts height and weight to metric values for the formula
 - **Retirement**
    - Input user's current age, annual salary, percentage saved (employer matches 35% of savings). Input desired retirement savings goal.
    - Return what age savings goal will be met.
    - You can assume death at 100 years (therefore, indicate if the savings goal is not met).
 - **Shortest Distance**
    - Input two points (x1, y1) (x2, y2) [4 values - indicate to user which values are being input]
    - Return the distance between the points using the distance formula (should be implemented without use of libraries with the exception of the square root function).
 - **Email Verifier**
    - Input a string, determine if it is a valid email address according to these stated requirements with required caveats:
        - Value entered can consist of text, optionally separated by periods. 
        - No periods can start or end the value entered.
        - Two periods together is invalid and the address must start with a non-numeric character.
        - Value entered can contain the following printable characters: !$%*+-=?^_{|}~ but not: "(),:;<>@[\]` (this function provides a good opportunity to use regular expressions).

## Naming & Organizational Content
Jest follows conventional naming for functions as typical JavaScript functions.
